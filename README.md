# 🎯 Motion Tracking

MATLAB-based motion tracking system using color detection and bounding boxes to quantify movement in video data.

## 📖 About

Built to computationally track motion as an alternative to tedious manual frame-by-frame video analysis. 

## 🔬 Use Cases

- Tracking limb/jaw motion during induced seizures
- Quantifying movement from motor cortex stimulation
- Validating accelerometer sensitivity against video analysis
- Any application requiring automated motion quantification from video with markers

## 🛠️ Methods

Two motion quantification approaches compared:
1. **Video analysis** - Color and bounding box tracking in MATLAB
2. **Accelerometer** - 3-axis sensor data

Tested on:
- Benchtop model (decaying oscillation of vibrating wire)
- Animal model (mouse paw during sciatic nerve stimulation)

## 📦 Requirements

- MATLAB
